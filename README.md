# Predicting-heart-condition

# Dataset Information:
The dataset consists of 303 rows and 14 columns with label Target. Data contains categorical as well as continuous data.

# Data Cleansing:
There is only one column that contains null value in which only two rows have null value that can easily be dropped by removing NA function.

# Data Visualization:
Data Visualization is done by step by step process with critical analysis. I used a correlation matrix to find most dependent variable to the label which is Age. 

# Methodology:
To explain and identify correct heart diagnosis and resolve the medical objective, diï¬€erent Machine Learning techniques were implemented to interpret the medical data. The aim of this project is to diagnose the heart disease and to improve the success standards for prediction. A few machine learning algorithms, such as: Random Forest, SVM (Support Vector Machine), Decision Tree and Logistics Regression were used for the training of the predictive model. These algorithms were executed on the model in order to help medical experts to predict and diagnose heart attacks from patient datasets. The main goal is to identify which machine learning algorithm shows the best accuracy for the prediction of heart disease from patients' dataset.

# Results:
Cross Validation was performed on all models. The results are similar but have some variance in accuracy. After Cross Validation was implemented, the results clearly indicated that Logistic Regression is the best solution for this problem.
